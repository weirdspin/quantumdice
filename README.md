# Quantum Dice

[**Live Demo**](https://your-live-demo-link-here) &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; A minimalist, provably fair dice game.

---

Quantum Dice is a sleek, single-page web application that offers a modern and transparent dice betting experience. Inspired by the principles of fairness and user control, this game is built with a focus on clean design and robust functionality.

## Features

- **Provably Fair Betting:** A transparent and verifiable betting system using a combination of a server seed, a client seed, and a nonce. The server seed is hashed and displayed before each roll, and the full seed is revealed afterward, allowing for complete verification of every roll.
- **Adjustable Risk & Payout:** Players can fine-tune their risk and potential reward by adjusting the win chance with a simple slider. The payout multiplier updates in real-time to reflect the current odds.
- **"Roll Under" & "Roll Over" Options:** Choose your strategy by betting on the roll to be under or over the target number.
- **Game History:** A detailed history of your recent bets, including the roll result, payout, and the server seed for verification.
- **Sound & Animation:** Engaging animations and sound effects provide a satisfying and immersive user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite
- **Styling:** CSS (with CSS Variables for theming)
- **Game Logic:** Plain JavaScript

## Provably Fair System

The provably fair system ensures that neither the player nor the house can manipulate the outcome of a roll. It works as follows:

1.  **Server Seed:** A random, secret seed is generated by the server.
2.  **Server Seed Hash:** The server seed is hashed using SHA-256 and shown to the player *before* the roll.
3.  **Client Seed:** The player can provide their own seed. This ensures the house cannot pre-calculate outcomes based on a known seed.
4.  **Nonce:** A number that increments with each bet.

Before the roll, the player has the server seed hash. After the roll, the server seed is revealed. The player can then use a third-party tool or the game's own verification feature to check that the hash of the revealed server seed matches the one shown before the roll, and that the combination of the server seed, client seed, and nonce produces the exact roll result.
