# Implementation Progress

## Summary

The project has successfully completed the foundational stages of development. The core game logic is fully implemented and separated from the UI, and the static user interface components have been scaffolded with placeholder data and styling. The project is now ready to move into the state management and interactivity phase.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Logic (The "Brain")
**Status: ✅ Complete**
- Project initialized using React + Vite.
- Core game logic functions (`calculatePayout`, `generateServerSeed`, `getRollResult`) are implemented in `src/gameLogic.js`.

### Phase 2: Static UI Development (The "Skeleton")
**Status: ✅ Complete**
- All primary UI components (`BetControls.jsx`, `PayoutDisplay.jsx`, `GameHistory.jsx`) have been created.
- A dark-mode theme and layout inspired by the Stake platform have been implemented with static placeholder data.

### Phase 3: State Management & Interactivity (The "Nervous System")
**Status: ❌ Not Started**
- The `App.jsx` component does not yet manage any state (e.g., balance, bet amount).
- UI controls are not yet wired up to state.
- The core game logic from `gameLogic.js` has not been integrated with the UI to handle button clicks or update game state.

### Phase 4: Provably Fair Implementation (The "Trust Layer")
**Status: ❌ Not Started**
- No state or UI elements related to the provably fair system have been implemented.

### Phase 5: Polishing (The "Shine")
**Status: ❌ Not Started**
- The roll animation, sound effects, and mobile responsiveness have not yet been implemented.

### Phase 6: Final Touches & Deployment
**Status: ❌ Not Started**
- The project has not yet been built for production or deployed.
- The `README.md` is not yet in its final state.

## Next Steps

The immediate focus should be on **Phase 3: State Management & Interactivity**. This involves:
1.  Adding `useState` hooks to `App.jsx` to manage the application's state.
2.  Passing state and event handlers down to the child components.
3.  Connecting the "Roll Dice" button to the core game logic to create a functional game loop.
