# Implementation Progress

## Summary

The project is now fully functional, with core logic, state management, and the provably fair system all implemented. The application is interactive, allowing users to place bets, see the results, and verify the fairness of the game. The focus has now shifted to polishing the user experience.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Logic (The "Brain")
**Status: ‚úÖ Complete**
- Project initialized using React + Vite.
- Core game logic functions (`calculatePayout`, `generateServerSeed`, `getRollResult`) are implemented in `src/gameLogic.js`.

### Phase 2: Static UI Development (The "Skeleton")
**Status: ‚úÖ Complete**
- All primary UI components (`BetControls.jsx`, `PayoutDisplay.jsx`, `GameHistory.jsx`) have been created.
- A dark-mode theme and layout inspired by the Stake platform have been implemented.

### Phase 3: State Management & Interactivity (The "Nervous System")
**Status: ‚úÖ Complete**
- State is managed in `App.jsx` using `useState` and `useEffect`.
- UI controls are fully interactive.
- The core game logic is connected to the UI, creating a complete game loop.

### Phase 4: Provably Fair Implementation (The "Trust Layer")
**Status: ‚úÖ Complete**
- A `ProvablyFair` component has been added to display the server seed hash, client seed, and nonce.
- The server seed is hashed before the roll and revealed in the game history afterward.

### Phase 5: Polishing (The "Shine")
**Status: üü° In Progress**
- **Roll Animation:** ‚úÖ Implemented a custom `useCountUp` hook for a smooth number animation on the roll result.
- **Sound Effects:** ‚ùå Not Started.
- **Responsiveness:** ‚ùå Not Started.

### Phase 6: Final Touches & Deployment
**Status: ‚ùå Not Started**
- The project has not yet been built for production or deployed.
- The `README.md` is not yet in its final state.

## Next Steps

The immediate focus is on completing **Phase 5: Polishing**. This involves:
1.  Integrating sound effects for key game events (roll, win, lose).
2.  Ensuring the application is fully responsive and usable on mobile devices.
