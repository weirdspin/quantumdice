Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

It is crucial to follow this implementation plan sequentially. This structured approach ensures that foundational logic is built first, preventing complex issues later and resulting in a high-quality, professional product.

Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Logic (The "Brain")

    Initialize Project: Choose React and set up the project structure.

    Game Logic Module: Create a separate, plain JavaScript file (e.g., gameLogic.js). Implement the core, non-UI functions here: calculatePayout, generateServerSeed, getRollResult(serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce). Write unit tests for these functions if you are comfortable doing so.

Phase 2: Static UI Development (The "Skeleton")

    Component Scaffolding: Build out the static React components for the UI: BetControls.jsx, PayoutDisplay.jsx, GameHistory.jsx.

    Layout & Styling: Use CSS/SCSS or a framework like Tailwind CSS to implement the dark-mode, Stake-inspired layout. Focus on getting the look right with placeholder data. Do not add any state or logic yet.

Phase 3: State Management & Interactivity (The "Nervous System")

    State Hooks: In your main App.jsx component, use useState to manage all critical state: balance, betAmount, sliderValue, betType, gameHistory, etc.

    Wire Up Controls: Connect the UI components to the state. The slider should update sliderValue, the input field should update betAmount, etc.

    Connect Logic to UI: Import your gameLogic.js functions. When the "Roll Dice" button is clicked, trigger the game logic, calculate the result, update the balance and gameHistory state.

Phase 4: Provably Fair Implementation (The "Trust Layer")

    PF State: Add state for serverSeedHash, clientSeed, and nonce.

    PF UI: Create UI elements for displaying the serverSeedHash, viewing/editing the clientSeed, and a "Verify" tab/modal.

    Integrate PF Logic: On game start, generate a serverSeed and its hash, displaying the hash. After the roll, reveal the full serverSeed in the game history for that specific bet.

Phase 5: Polishing (The "Shine")

    Roll Animation: Implement the animated number counter that "rolls" to the result.

    Sound Effects: Integrate an audio library like Howler.js or use the native <audio> element to play sounds on click, roll, win, and lose.

    Responsiveness: Ensure the layout looks clean and is usable on mobile screen sizes.

Phase 6: Final Touches & Deployment

    Production Build: Create a production build of your application (npm run build).

    GitHub Pages Setup: Go to your repository settings -> Pages. Select the main branch and the /docs or / folder (depending on your build output) to deploy.

    README: Create the final, professional README.md. Explain the project, the tech stack, and prominently feature the live demo link at the very top. I will help you write this when the time comes.
